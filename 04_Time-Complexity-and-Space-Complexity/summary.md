# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

1. Time Complexity : Big-O notation
2. Big-o notation : Constant time(O(1)), Linear Time(O(n)), linear time2(O(n+m)), logarithmic time(O(logn)),
                    quadratic time(O(n^2)), Exponential and Factorial time(O(2^n) && O(n!))
3. Time limit : the expected time complexity for each big-O notation
4. Space Complexity : how much memory is used every time the program is executed
